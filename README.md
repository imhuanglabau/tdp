# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Setting Up the Project

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/imhuanglabau/tdp.git
   cd tdp
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh

   ```

## Running the Project

To run the project, use the following command:
```sh
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. The project will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Contributing to the Project

To contribute to the project, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b my-feature-branch
   ```

3. Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive commit message:
   ```sh
   git commit -m "Add new feature"
   ```

4. Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```sh
   git push origin my-feature-branch
   ```

5. Create a pull request from your branch to the main repository's `main` branch.

Please ensure that your code follows the project's coding standards and includes appropriate tests.
